# BreakoutJS
Completed Mozila tutorial for the Breakout game using pure JS

The tutorial can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

On my own, I managed to:

1. Add a mechanic that changes the ball behavior depending on the direction the paddle is moving when the ball colides with it. I believe that it's possible for ball's DX to reach 0; however, I couldn't test this in-game.

2. Make a few cosmetic changes on the look and feel of the game by:
	
	a) adding more bricks
  
	b) polished the speed of the paddle. Right now, it only works when playing with the keyboard
  
	c) creating room below the paddle. To do so, I needed to change the logic of the "game over"
  
	d) made it a bit prettier (to my eyes, hehe) using my, right now, non-existent CSS and HTML skills
  
CONTROLS:

-- Right and left arrows on the keyboard

-- Mice movement (unsure if the best way to play the game)

That's it. Bye!
